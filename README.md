# AFDIM_Face_Recognition_Login

Student project to conceptualize a sign-up and log-in for exams using facial recognition at our university.
Class: "Aktuelle Fragestellungen des Information Management" with [Prof. Staab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugen-staab-31b32a16/recent-activity/all/). 1st semester Master Information Management at [Hochschule Kaiserslautern](https://www.hs-kl.de/).

TinyDB used to instatiate a database for exams, exam sign-ups, students, admins.
Python with TKinter and OpenCV used to create a GUI where the user has to stand in front of the camera and press a button to confirm that he wants to write the exam. If the user is recognized and signed up for the exam, it is logged in the database.

Error Handling (User not signed up for exam / User not recognized / etc.) is implemented.
